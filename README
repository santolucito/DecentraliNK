# DecentraliNK

This is the code that handles the communication between client and server.
The eventual workflow should be:

when a SD card is plugged into the client, a menu pops up allowing the user to select a file on the touchscreen that they want to download (tv shows, today's news, etc).
The server then sends that file directly to the SD device, and we are all set!

## Local Testing

To test locally, we need a ssh server running that accepts connections on port 22.
The exact way to set up a ssh server will depend on your environment

    sudo mkdir -p -m0755 /var/run/sshd
    sudo /usr/sbin/sshd

Once you have the ssh server up (for scp'ing the file), install

    cabal sandbox init
    cabal install

Then run the client and server...

    echo <password> | sudo -S ./dist/.../NKClient &
    echo <password> | sudo -S ./dist/.../NKServer &

and then simulate a usb device being plugged in

    echo "message" | netcat localhost 4242

## Building for Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi uses armv7 architecture, while any reasonable dev machine is x86.
We could try cross-compilation, but its just easier to build directly on a raspberry pi.
To do this, we have an SD card with a raspi image that is only used for ghc compiliation and has an internet connection setup. 
We build on that image, then copy the static binaries to a usb, then pull the binaries off the usb and onto the deployment raspis.
